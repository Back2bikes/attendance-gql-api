# attendance-gql-api
This is essentially a fork of the GraphQL/React project https://github.com/Back2bikes/b2b-gql-react and splits out ther GraphQL server function of that project.

The benefits of the this approach are:
- Its easier to work on the Front and the Back end oin parallel
- It's easier to containerise the back end
- Test scripts in the project can focus soley on API testing
